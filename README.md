# Overview:

Initial scope for backend:

* Build backend that receives height and weight params, either in metric or us units
* Implemnt backend in typescript
* The backend will return a response containing the BMI value.
* The calculation of the BMI should happen in the backend
* The backend will use express, node and typescript
* add run instructions

# Further steps:
* Deploy on aws
* Add MongoDB backend to record weight entries

(both are contigent on creating frontend as well)
